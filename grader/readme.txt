I am a maths teacher. I have to grade a lot of papers. Why not do it in the quickest way possible?
This program was made with the objective of grading a paper with the fewest amount of clicks possible.
While it's easier to just divide the grade by the amount of questions and multiply by the amount of correct answers the student got, I like to be fair and give marks to the students for their thought processes. They didn't get the question right, but maybe he was going in the right direction. Maybe there is something of value in their assessment. I think that's the ethical thing to do when grading papers.
