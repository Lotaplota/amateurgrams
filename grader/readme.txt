I am a math's teacher. I have to grade a lot of papers. Why not do it in the quickest way possible?
This program was made with the objective of grading a test with the fewest amount of clicks possible.
While it's easier to just divide the grade by the amount of questions and multiply by the amount of correct answers the student got, I like to be fair and give marks to the students for their thought processes. In case they don't get the question right, maybe he was going in the right direction. Maybe there is something of value in their assessment. I think that's the ethical thing to do when grading tests.

PROGRAM DETAILS
The program will ask you how many questions does your test have, the weight of each question, and how many marks can each question get. You have the options to change all of these when the program is running.
When all preferences are set, you are supposed to feed the program the sequence of marks a particular student got. The program will
    1. multiply the amount of marks earned in each question by their respective weights
    2. sum the previous values
    3. divide the total amount by marks * questions
    4. round the value by 2 decimal places
    5. display the calculated grade to the user.
The program will then prompt the user for another set of marks. The previous grade will stay displayed until a new set of grades is fed.
